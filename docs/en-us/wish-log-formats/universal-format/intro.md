# Universal Wish Format - Introduction
<!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

The *Universal Wish Format*, officially named ***Uniformed Interchangeable Gacha log Format Standard*** (or ***the UIGF Standard*** for short), is a set of wish log storage specifications designed for the effective delivery of logs among various *Genshin Impact* wish log export & analysis tools.

At present, the Universal Wish Format contains two variants: *Workbook* (or *Excel* ), and *JSON*.

Due to some compromises on drafting, the orthodox UIGF standard only claims support for Simplified Chinese language only and assumes all the wish log items are in Chinese.

Currently, there exists some tools using the Universal Format or its derived forms as the data storage format. Several tools have provided import and export support. Visit [Support Status](wish-log-formats/universal-format/support-status.md) for details.

?> The idea of a Universal Wish Format was originally proposed by [@Scighost](https://github.com/Scighost). The UIGF Standard was drawn up by [@biuuu](https://github.com/biuuu), [@Lightczx](https://github.com/Lightczx), [@Scighost](https://github.com/Scighost), [@sunfkny](https://github.com/sunfkny), [@TremblingMoeNew](https://github.com/TremblingMoeNew) in discussion *[关于规范祈愿记录导出格式的建议](https://github.com/xunkong/KeqingNiuza/discussions/58)* *(Proposal for a standardized export format of the wish logs)*. For now, the latest version of the standard is ***UIGF`v2.2`***.

!> *The Universal Wish Format* is not a officially-recognized name. <br/>The English version UIGF standard in *DodocoTales Wish Log Format Library* is not a official translation.
